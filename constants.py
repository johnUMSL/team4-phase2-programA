#A description of the program 
SUMMARY = """\nThis program validates internal log files. It first checks for properly formatted file names
(XLog.csv - where X is a string of alphabetic characters), then checks for properly formatted file contents. 
The program outputs errors and/or incorrect formats to an external report file and to the screen. 
After the program processes all the files with a valid filename, the program outputs a final report
and halts with a goodbye message.
